## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://theouo.github.io/Daily-Planner/)

For this project, I create a daily planner where users can input their tasks for the day.

## Usage 

This site is quite easy to navigate through. Once you load it, you are presented with a daily planner where you can input your tasks for the day as you see fit. You can plan your day from 9AM to 5PM and whatever you input will be saved on the page whenever you return to it.


## Learning Points 
I got  to work with the Day.JS and JQUERY APIs where I learnt more on the techniques needed to properly build this project.
